## ðŸ“Š Step 1: Training Data Features

The model learns from **historical data (2022-2024)** with these features:

| Feature | Description | Example Value |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `market_encoded` | 0=CAISO, 1=ERCOT, 2=MISO | 1 (ERCOT) |
| `month` | Month of year | 7 (July) |
| `block_encoded` | 0=OffPeak, 1=Peak | 1 (Peak) |
| `avg_generation_MW` | Average generation in that month-block | 45.5 MW |
| `avg_RT_price` | Average real-time hub price | $52.30/MWh |
| `avg_DA_price` | Average day-ahead hub price | $50.20/MWh |

**Target Variable**: `realized_price` = `avg_DA_price` (what actually happened)

## ðŸ§® Step 2: Model Prediction (Gradient Boosting)

The trained model is a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** with ~150 trees. It learns patterns like:

- "July in ERCOT Peak typically realizes $X/MWh"
- "Higher generation correlates with certain price outcomes"
- "DA prices are strong predictors of realized prices"

### Example Prediction:

**Input (July 2026, ERCOT, Peak, Valentino)**:
